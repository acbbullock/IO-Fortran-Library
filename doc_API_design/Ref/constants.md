The [[io_fortran_lib]] module provides access to a handful of `parameter` [constants](../../module/io_fortran_lib.html#variable-lf) for use as string terminators and separators:

* `LF`: The new line character (line feed).
* `NL`: The new line character (line feed, alternate name).
* `CR`: The carriage return character.
* `FF`: The form feed character.
* `VT`: The vertical tab character.
* `NUL`: The null character.
* `CNUL`: The C null character re-exported from `iso_c_binding`.
