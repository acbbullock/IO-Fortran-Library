# API Documentation

This API documentation was generated by [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) (the Fortran documentation generator).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a portable, standard I/O library for Modern Fortran programs supporting the Fortran 2018 standard, with the goal of enabling essential I/O functionality for Fortran programmers on any system and with any modern compiler.

## Scope

The IO Fortran Library is a Fortran module [[io_fortran_lib]] which provides high level routines for doing internal and external I/O. In particular, the module provides a handful of generic interfaces and a simple derived type for doing string-based and array-based I/O that are useful for recording program data, reading data into programs, writing formatted logs and output, and for doing advanced string manipulations. For instance, one may read and write data from/to `.csv` and `.dat` files, represent numbers as strings inside of a string expression, efficiently write text to a `.log` file, and dynamically manipulate strings with a `String` type (including casting between numeric and string data).

@note The module is fully self-contained, with no external dependencies, and is written to be portable and compliant to the Fortran 2018 standard such that no special extensions or compiler options should be required. The public interfaces accept all intrinsic numeric types (`integer`, `real`, and `complex`) and all standard kinds provided by the intrinsic `iso_fortran_env` module (`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `real32`, `real64`, and `real128`). All array-based routines additionally support up to rank 15.

## How to Use

To use `io_fortran_lib` with your [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) project, add the following lines to your `fpm.toml` file and `use` the module in your program units to access the routines:

```toml
[dependencies]
IO-Fortran-Library = { git="https://github.com/acbbullock/IO-Fortran-Library", branch="main" }
```

See the [important user information](page/UserInfo/index.html) and [reference guide](page/Ref/index.html) for information about calling the [routines](lists/procedures.html), and further see the [tutorials](page/Examples/index.html) for complete example programs.
