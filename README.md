# IO Fortran Library

The IO Fortran Library is a Fortran module `io_fortran_lib` which provides high level routines for doing internal and external I/O. In particular, the module provides a handful of generic interfaces for performing string-based and array-based I/O that are useful for recording program data, reading data into programs, and for writing formatted logs and output. For instance, one may write/read numeric data to/from `.csv` and `.dat` files, represent single numbers as strings inside of a string expression, and efficiently write strings to a `.log` file.

*Note*

The module is fully self-contained, with no external dependencies, and is written to be portable and compliant to the Fortran 2018 standard such that no special extensions or compiler options should be required. All generic interfaces which take numeric arguments support all of the standard kinds provided by the intrinsic `iso_fortran_env` module, including `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `real32`, `real64`, and `real128`. All array-based routines additionally support up to rank 15.

## How to Use

To use `io_fortran_lib` with your [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) project, add the following lines to your `fpm.toml` file and `use` the module in your program units to access the routines:

```toml
[dependencies]
IO-Fortran-Library = { git="https://github.com/acbbullock/IO-Fortran-Library", branch="main" }
```

## Documentation

The API documentation for this project was generated by [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) (the Fortran documentation generator) and is available at [API documentation](https://acbbullock.github.io/IO-Fortran-Library/doc/index.html). To view the documentation locally, clone this repository and view `/doc/index.html` in your browser.

The following links to the documentation provide user instructions for each of the publicly accessible interfaces:

* [`interface str`](https://acbbullock.github.io/IO-Fortran-Library/doc/page/Ref/str.html): A function for representing a number as a string.
* [`interface echo`](https://acbbullock.github.io/IO-Fortran-Library/doc/page/Ref/echo.html): A subroutine for recording a string to an external file.
* [`interface to_file`](https://acbbullock.github.io/IO-Fortran-Library/doc/page/Ref/to_file.html): A subroutine for recording an array to an external file.
* [`interface from_file`](https://acbbullock.github.io/IO-Fortran-Library/doc/page/Ref/from_file.html): A subroutine for reading an external file into an array.
* [`interface aprint`](https://acbbullock.github.io/IO-Fortran-Library/doc/page/Ref/aprint.html): A subroutine for printing arrays and array sections to stdout.
