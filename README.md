# IO Fortran Library

The IO Fortran Library is a Fortran module `io_fortran_lib` which provides high level routines for doing internal and external I/O. In particular, the module provides a handful of generic interfaces and a simple derived type for string-based and array-based I/O that are useful for recording program data, reading data into programs, and for writing formatted logs and output. For instance, one may read/write data of uniform or mixed type from/to `.csv` and `.dat` files, represent numbers as strings inside of a string expression, efficiently stream text data to a `.log` file, and perform advanced character manipulations with a `String` type.

To use `io_fortran_lib` with your [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) project, add the following lines to your `fpm.toml` file and `use` the module in your program units to access the routines:

```toml
[dependencies]
IO-Fortran-Library = { git="https://github.com/acbbullock/IO-Fortran-Library", branch="main" }
```

The module is fully self-contained, with no external dependencies, and is written to be portable and compliant to the Fortran 2018 standard such that no special extensions or compiler options should be required. All generic interfaces which take numeric arguments support all of the standard kinds provided by the intrinsic `iso_fortran_env` module, including `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `real32`, `real64`, and `real128`. All array-based routines additionally support up to rank 15.

## Documentation

The API documentation for this project was generated by [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) (the Fortran documentation generator) and is available at [API documentation](https://acbbullock.github.io/IO-Fortran-Library/doc/index.html).
